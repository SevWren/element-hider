# 🌟 Element Hider: TM's Masterpiece

Element Hider is a lightweight, user-friendly Chrome extension that allows you to **hide unwanted elements** on web pages using customizable CSS selectors and presets. Whether you're tired of ads, distractions, or just want a cleaner browsing experience, this extension has you covered! 🎯

📝 **Created for my memoir in Middle School, California** – This project is inspired by my coding journey back in the day when I was just starting out. Element Hider is a tribute to the creative spark that lit my path into tech. 🌈

## 🎉 Features

* **Custom CSS Selectors**: Enter your own CSS selectors to hide specific elements.
* **Preset Management**: Choose from predefined sets of selectors for common annoyances like ads, pop-ups, or social media distractions.
* **Real-Time Updates**: Changes are applied immediately to the current tab.
